# Boosting Protein Graph Representations through Static-Dynamic Fusion

This repository is for the paper "Boosting Protein Graph Representations through Static-Dynamic Fusion" accepted at ICML 2025.

## Overview

We propose a novel heterogeneous graph representation that integrates both static structural information and dynamic correlations from molecular dynamics trajectories for protein modeling. Our approach applies relational graph neural networks to process these enriched representations.

## Status

Code is currently being organized and will be released later.
